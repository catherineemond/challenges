- base cases:
  - one-char str || empty str -> true
  - if first and last are different -> false

- top-down: -> pretend you already have the function
- bottom-up -> start with base case (smallest sub-problem)

- time/space complexity
  - branching factor: 1
  - depth: N
  - time complexity: O(N)
  - space complexity: O(N*N)
    - tail recursion?? -> O(N) ??
